# This script performs a network scan on a given IP address and a list of ports, checking for SSL and telephony services.
# The main function sets the target IP address and the list of target ports. It then calls the apply_evasion and apply_obfuscation functions to set up the scan.
# The scan_target function is then called with the target IP and ports. This function performs the actual network scan and returns a dictionary of results. Each key in the dictionary is a port number, and the value is another dictionary with the results of the SSL and telephony scans for that port.
# After the scan is complete, the results are saved to a JSON file named 'scan_results.json'. The json.dump function is used to write the results to the file. The 'indent' argument is set to 4 to format the JSON data with indentation, making it easier to read.
# The script then prints a message indicating that the results have been saved.
# The script is designed to be run as a standalone program. The if __name__ == "__main__": check at the end of the script ensures that the main function is only called if the script is run directly, and not if it is imported as a module.
